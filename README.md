# cpp_boilerplate

This is a minimalistic example of how I manage a new C++ project.

The particular example in this project is one of a handler class managing it's
associated clients, with a facility for message passing between clients and
handler. It's just some leftover testing I was doing once upon a time.

I've put this here so that I can re-use it next time I have to do a quick test
in C++, and so that others may also get something useful from it.
